<h3>New sensor</h3>

<p>The 33MP FSI CMOS sensor at the heart of the EOS R6 III is a new one for Canon's hybrid mirrorless lineup, having only appeared recently in the <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/0631874757/canon-eos-c50-cinema-camera-announcement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cinema-focused EOS C50</a>. Canon isn't claiming any particular technological leaps with this sensor, but our initial testing shows that it has even faster readout speeds than the lower-resolution chip found in the EOS R6 II. As usual for Canon, it has a dual pixel design with two sub-pixels at each location, one capturing the left half of the image, the other capturing the right, allowing the entire sensor to be used for phase detection AF.</p>
<p>The faster readout speeds, paired with changes to the card slot and processor (Canon says it's the same generation, but has some improvements) allow for big improvements to video capture. The stabilization system has also gotten a bit of a bump, going from 8EV to 8.5EV.</p><p></p><h3>Updated ports</h3>
<p></p><p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/6602693486/product-shots/canon_eos_r6iii_ports.jpeg" target="article-6602693486" data-bw-imp-id="32d7fb9e-ad00-4af3-9708-650a927cf993" data-bw-id="bw-32d7fb9e-ad00" data-bw-nonce="b49c5dc1-ced6-4f71-9d6f-92ff78870f21" data-bw-event-track="true"><img alt="canon eos r6iii ports" data-aspect-ratio="4x3" data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="443" src="https://reader-api.slax.dev/static/image?u=https%253A%252F%252F4.img-dpreview.com%252Ffiles%252Fp%252FE%7ETC4x3S590x0%7Earticles%252F6602693486%252Fproduct-shots%252Fcanon_eos_r6iii_ports.jpeg&r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpreview.com%2Freviews%2Fcanon-eos-r6-iii-initial-review&d=574d8aa3fba212309c62c7aed0266430" width="590" data-filename="product-shots/canon_eos_r6iii_ports.jpeg" srcset="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TC4x3S1180x0~articles/6602693486/product-shots/canon_eos_r6iii_ports.jpeg 2x"></a></p>
<p>The EOS R6 III replaces one of its predecessor's dual UHS-II SD card slots with a CFexpress Type B one. While you can still use most of the camera's features with an SD card, you will need to use the faster, larger and more expensive storage to record Raw video.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Speaking of video, the EOS R6 II's microHDMI port is no more on the EOS R6 III. In its place is a full-size one, which is much more appropriate on a camera destined to be many people's workhorse.</p><p></p><h3>Better burst</h3>
<p></p><p>Despite having the same rates, the EOS R6 III improves on its predecessor's burst rates, no longer requiring a special Raw Burst mode to enable pre-burst capture. Instead, there's now a pre-continuous shooting option that you can simply enable when in the H+ drive mode. Canon says this is largely thanks to that CFexpress card slot and its faster write speeds.</p>
<p>Raw Burst mode is no longer on the camera, though it's hard to be sad about that. While there were benefits to Raw Burst mode, such as it displaying bursts as a single thumbnail in the playback menu, it was overall a relatively clunky experience. To edit the photos you took outside of Canon's own software, you had to select the individual frames you want, and save them as a standard .CR3 Raw files, JPEGs, HEIFs or combinations thereof. That extra step is no longer necessary.</p>
<p>Canon also now says the shutter has been durability tested to 500,000 actuations. We're not used to Canon explicitly giving a figure for a camera at this level.</p><p></p>
<h3>Raw, 7K and open-gate video</h3>
<p></p><p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/6602693486/product-shots/canon_eos_r6iii_mode_dial.jpeg" target="article-6602693486" data-bw-imp-id="45b66674-05e0-40d7-9f40-39551a343eb9" data-bw-id="bw-45b66674-05e0" data-bw-nonce="b49c5dc1-ced6-4f71-9d6f-92ff78870f21" data-bw-event-track="true"><img alt="canon eos r6iii mode dial" data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="394" src="https://reader-api.slax.dev/static/image?u=https%253A%252F%252F2.img-dpreview.com%252Ffiles%252Fp%252FE%7ETS590x0%7Earticles%252F6602693486%252Fproduct-shots%252Fcanon_eos_r6iii_mode_dial.jpeg&r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpreview.com%2Freviews%2Fcanon-eos-r6-iii-initial-review&d=b15343b037b47199ea44398d84cd6fd8" width="590" data-filename="product-shots/canon_eos_r6iii_mode_dial.jpeg" srcset="https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/6602693486/product-shots/canon_eos_r6iii_mode_dial.jpeg 2x"></a></p>
<p>The Canon EOS R6 III gains the ability to record Raw video internally at up to 7K/60 in Canon's proprietary Canon Cinema Raw format. It can also now shoot 'open-gate' video at up to 7K/30, recording the entire area of the sensor to produce a 3:2 image that you can take vertical and landscape crops from.</p>
<p>The menus for selecting your recording mode have also been updated. The EOS R6 II presented you with an overwhelming list containing each possible combination of resolution, frame rate and compression settings, but the EOS R6 III thankfully lets you choose these all independently.</p>
<p>The EOS R6 III also now gains a dedicated red tally lamp, making it obvious to both you and your on-screen talent when you're recording.</p><p></p><h3>AF Upgrades</h3>
<p></p><p>Looking at the autofocus system, it seems largely the same as the one in the EOS R6 II, with subject recognition support for people, animals and vehicles, as well as an auto mode. However, Canon says the algorithms underpinning those modes have been updated to match the ones on cameras like the EOS R1 and EOS R5 II, making it even more reliable.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>The EOS R6 III also gains the <span>Register People Priority feature, where you can train it to recognize a specific person and principally focus on tracking them over other people that may be in the scene.</span></p>
<p>While the cameras theoretically have 'Digic X' processors, Canon says it's made intergenerational improvements to the chip that allow for some of the EOS R6 III's new features.</p><p></p><hr>

<p>The EOS R6 III is Canon's enthusiast-tier full-frame camera, which means it's designed to excel at pretty much whatever you want to shoot with it. Like the rest of the cameras in this class (and its predecessor), it's capable enough for most kinds of photography, from landscape shooting to fast-paced action and sports, and comes equipped with the kinds of video features you would've had to buy a cinema camera to get just a few years ago. It also has weather sealing and dual card slots.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some things that separate it from the even higher-end Stacked sensor cameras like Canon's own EOS R5 II. It misses out on a bit of extra resolution and a few features that pros might want, such as the ability to control the focus point with your eye, in-camera 'AI' upscaling and Action Priority modes. <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/interviews/0383076524/canon-cp-plus-2025-interview-go-tokura" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Canon says</a> the latter two require a still-expensive co-processor that just wasn't in the budget for this camera, but it should still easily handle whatever tasks enthusiasts throw at it.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>It can shoot at a 40fps burst rate for up to 150 shots in Raw and JPEG, and supports pre-burst capture, which can help if you're just a bit too slow to the shutter. You no longer have to use the somewhat clunky Raw burst mode to access these features, like you did with the EOS R6 II.</p>

<p>Canon has included its now-standard autofocus system, which has subject recognition for people, animals and vehicles, as well as an auto mode that searches for those within the scene. It also supports registering a specific person and having the camera prioritize them when choosing which subject to focus on.</p>
<p>It also supports HDR output, with its ability to produce 10-bit HEIF stills with the PQ tone curve, in place of JPEGs. While PQ isn't as broadly supported as the HLG curve used by other companies like Nikon and Panasonic, it can, at least, simultaneously record both HEIF and Raws, unlike Sony, which makes you choose between Raw capture and HDR output files. When shooting video, it can capture HDR video footage using either PQ or HLG. The latter is more widely supported when it comes to playback and is a new addition compared to the EOS R6 II.</p>
<p>Speaking of video, the EOS R6 III is well-equipped for motion pictures too. It supports internal Raw recording, a false color overlay to help you nail exposure and the &gt;4K open gate capture gives you greater flexibility in post.</p><p></p><hr>
<h2 id="HC">The EOS R6 III in context</h2>
<p></p><p>The EOS R6 III is launching into a market segment with robust competition. Its predecessor was still quite a sensible option, so we've included it in the comparison, alongside the Nikon Z6III, which offers a similar combination of fast shooting, top-tier autofocus and incredible video specs. We're also comparing the Sony a7 IV, as its 33MP sensor makes it an obvious competitor, even if it can't match the speed of the other cameras on this list.</p><p></p><p></p><table>

<span>*When combined with a stabilized lens</span><p></p>
<p></p><p>The Z6III's partially Stacked sensor has higher read noise than other designs, which gives it a disadvantage when raising the shadows (though, importantly, this has no impact on the midtones). We'll have to wait until we get a production EOS R6 III to see how it performs in this regard. In both cases, it's worth checking to make sure whether the lenses you want exist before choosing a system, as both companies place restrictions on third-party lens makers.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>While the a7 IV is still a quite capable camera, it's starting to look a little dated compared to the competition. Its rolling shutter performance when shooting full-width video is noticeably bad, it doesn't offer internal Raw video (though it's not an essential feature for most users), and while its autofocus is extremely capable, it's no longer the best that Sony offers. While Sony does allow third-party lenses on E-mount, buyers should be aware that it limits non-Sony lenses to 15fps (not that this is a problem for the a7 IV, with its 10fps max burst rate).</p><p></p><hr>

<p>The EOS R6 III hews close to Canon's <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/5354325480/a-visit-to-canon-in-japan-and-why-it-wants-to-be-the-porsche-911-of-photography" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tried-and-true design formula</a>, and its body is very similar – though not exactly the same – as the EOS R6 II. It has a hefty grip that fits well in your hand, even with a heavier lens attached. It has an array of customizable buttons – nine in total – which can have different functions depending on whether you're in stills or video mode. Switching between the two modes is handled by a dedicated lever to the left of the EVF.</p>
<p>The autofocus joystick and surrounding buttons are placed within easy reach of where your thumb naturally falls when you're holding the camera, and are grouped in ways that helps you tell which one you're pressing by feel, even when your eye is up to the EVF.</p><p></p><h3>Screen and viewfinder</h3>

<p>The viewfinder and LCD have been unchanged from the EOS R6 II, though that's not really a complaint. The rear 3.0" screen is fully-articulated, which will be welcome to those using the camera for video. It's relatively bright, but can be a little difficult to see in extremely bright sunlight.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>The viewfinder is large and can refresh at up to 120fps for a very responsive preview. It's not the highest resolution model out there, though, and it can't quite manage to show you a proper HDR preview when you're shooting in PQ mode, though it does have Canon's <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/2575223440/canon-eos-r3-s-ovf-simulation-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OVF simulation mode</a> that gives you a better idea of how much dynamic range you're capturing, at the cost of truly previewing your exposure.</p>
<p>There's no discernible viewfinder blackout when shooting in at the highest burst rate settings using the electronic viewfinder, though it'll show up when shooting in lower burst rates or with the mechanical shutter.</p><p></p><h3>Ports</h3>
<p></p><p>The EOS R6 III has all the connectivity you might expect from this class of camera: USB C, headphone and microphone sockets, a multi-function hotshoe, 2.5mm remote terminal and full-size HDMI port. The latter represents a bit upgrade from the less-reliable and robust microHDMI port found on the EOS R6 II.</p>
<p>It has two card slots: one CFexpress Type B, and one UHS-II SD. You'll have to use the former if you want to record Raw video internally.</p><p></p>
<h3>Battery</h3>

<p>The EOS R6 III uses 16Wh LP-E6P battery, to give battery life ratings of 270 shots per charge via the viewfinder and 510 if you use the rear screen. These numbers jump to 390 and 620, respectively, if you engage power saving mode. As always, the CIPA-defined tests tend to under-represent how many images you can actually get, with double the rated figure not being unusual, but they're useful to compare between cameras. These are reasonable but not great for a camera likely to be used quite heavily by an enthusiast photographer.</p>
<p>The camera will still work with older batteries such as the LP-E6NH, though it warns that not all features will be available, and that some accessories won't work. Most notably, the camera loses support for network connectivity, refusing to connect to your smartphone or other devices.</p><p></p><hr>

<p>The EOS R6 III The highlights are its ability to record 7K open-gate footage at up to 30p, and support for oversampled 4K footage at up to 60p. It also lets you record in Canon's C-Log 2 or 3 response curves, and now has a button that defaults to opening the Color menu, making it a bit easier to switch between Log and non-Log recording.</p>
<p>It provides both DCI and UHD 4K options, though, humorously, the true 24fps mode is only available when recording DCI. Its Raw mode also lacks a 16:9 mode, but can record open-gate at up to 30p, from which you can take a UHD crop.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Its autofocus options remain the same throughout its recording modes; you still get continuous autofocus with subject recognition even when recording 4K/120 and 1080p/180. This is true both in the standard video recording mode and in the Slow-and-Fast mode that doesn't record audio and produces a file that plays back at a slower framerate.</p><p></p><h3>Recording modes</h3>
<p></p><p>While the EOS R6 III shares a sensor with the fan-cooled EOS C50, Canon includes several more options on its more cinema-focused camera. As an example, the EOS R6 III doesn't have an HQ Raw mode, nor does it support crop modes in Raw. It can, however, still record proxy files to its SD card slot, which could be quite useful when shooting Raw video.</p><p></p><p></p><table>

<p></p><p>Both the 4K and Full HD modes can be used in the "Fine" oversampling modes at all but their highest frame rates; the former from 7K capture, and the latter from 3.5K capture. However, Canon does note that, while the 4K/60 Fine mode is still oversampled, it won't have the same image quality that you get from the 4K/30 and slower modes.</p><p></p><h3>Rolling shutter</h3>
<p></p><p>The R6 III has some truly impressive rolling shutter rates across its full-width recording modes, achieving excellent readout speeds in pretty much every mode we tested (though we haven't been able to measure the Raw modes yet, as we aren't able to decode the footage). Using the oversampled "fine" setting will roughly double the readout speeds over the standard ones, suggesting the standard mode is skipping half the lines, but they're still quick enough that fine mode should be usable in almost any scenario.</p><p></p><p></p><table>

<h3>Temperature limits</h3>
<p></p><p>Unlike the video-focused EOS C50, the EOS R6 III is not fan-cooled. Canon has given the following figures for continuous recording times at 23°C (73°F). Taking shorter clips with some rest time between them is likely to give much longer durations.</p><p></p><p></p><table>

<p></p><p>The subsampled 4K/60 modes along with both subsampled and oversampled 'Fine' 4K modes at 30p and slower have no temperature restrictions. It's worth being aware of these limits if and when you use the camera's more ambitious modes.</p><p></p><h3>Workflow</h3>
<p></p><p>Canon includes a variety of tools to help making shooting video and, in particular, nailing exposure, easier. The EOS R6 III has options for both waveform monitoring, which provides more detail about what parts of your image are clipping than a traditional histogram, and a false color overlay, which makes it easier to tell if your skin tones are properly exposed.</p>
<p>It's also now <em>much</em> easier to set your white balance in video mode; you can capture it from the live view, rather than having to set it from a still image on the card (a process that, on other Canon cameras, meant switching into stills mode, taking a picture of your gray card, then switching back into the video mode before diving back into the settings). Speaking of live view, the camera also provides access to level gauges and magnification while recording, so you can make sure your horizon is perfect and your subject is in focus while you're rolling.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>The EOS R6 III lets you upload LUTs into the camera, so you can preview an effect you wish to apply, but you can't bake the result into your footage. The EOS R6 III can output lower-resolution proxy files to an SD card while you capture your main footage to the CFexpress card. The only exception is Open gate shooting, where you can capture a proxy alongside Raw shooting but not if you're using MP4 as your main output.</p>
<p>One feature Canon's retained for its cinema cameras is shutter angle, which derives the shutter speed from the recording framerate, rather than an absolute setting. This means you don't have to adjust your shutter speed after changing frame rates to retain the same level of motion blur. It's a setting that most of the EOS R6 III's competitors, such as the Nikon Z6III and Panasonic S1II, have, but that it lacks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p>Is it weird to say that the EOS R6 III is kind of surprising? Not the mere fact of its existence, of course; the enthusiast full-frame camera is the market's bread-and-butter, so Canon updating its model makes sense. But it feels like the kind of upgrade you'd see from a company trying to claw customers away from competitors, not one already at the top of the market.</p>
<p>The EOS R6 II, which Canon says will remain in its lineup for at least the medium term, is still a very competitive camera. Not only does it earn second place in our <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/buying-guide-best-cameras-under-2500" target="article-6602693486">under $2500 buying guide</a>, but Canon tells us it's the top-selling full-frame camera on the market, from any brand. It feels like Canon could've just made a few small improvements and called it a day, and if you just glance at the spec sheet or list of new features, you might get the impression that it has. But the changes it's made are ones that really matter, especially when it comes to competing with the other cameras in this class.</p><p></p><blockquote>It feels like Canon looked at what other companies were doing, and said "okay, us too, but better."</blockquote>

The EOS R6 III does too, but with the blistering speeds of the lower-res Nikon Z6III and Panasonic S1II, so you no longer have to pick between higher resolution and being able to shoot faster than 10fps. Those two cameras also offer Raw video, another spec the EOS R6 III has caught up on. And for good measure, Canon threw in full-width 4K 120p for the people who like slow-mo, and open gate recording, since Panasonic shooters are so keen on it.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>With every Canon release, there are people quick to point out how it's segmenting the market; what features does it lack that higher-end models do? Of course, there are features the much more expensive EOS R5 II has that this doesn't, but they're ones <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/interviews/0383076524/canon-cp-plus-2025-interview-go-tokura/1#AP" target="article-6602693486">we're told have hardware costs</a> and that, frankly, most people won't find themselves missing. If there are features Canon cut to make its more expensive models more appealing, they aren't obvious to me.</p><p></p><p><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="326" id="videoFrame" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nI1gL6f3wUQ?rel=0&autohide=1&wmode=transparent&enablejsapi=1" width="580" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></p>
<p></p><p>Canon says this camera is still squarely aimed at stills shooters, albeit ones who also need to be able to shoot video, so we're definitely looking forward to getting our hands on a production model to see if the ultra-fast sensor comes with any image quality impact, as was the case with the Nikon Z6III's<a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/9570948051/nikon-z6iii-added-to-studio-scene" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> 'partially Stacked' sensor</a>. Even if there is, though, we're clearly well into the evolution of Canon's 6-series line; in the DSLR days, the EOS 6D was a decent camera, but one with obvious compromises relative to higher-end models. With the EOS R6 III, those compromises are getting much harder to find.</p><p></p><div><hr><div><p><a href="https://www.adorama.com/car6m3.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-bw-imp-id="68fb5f37-4117-43a9-bc05-4fd912409a52" data-bw-id="bw-68fb5f37-4117" data-bw-nonce="b49c5dc1-ced6-4f71-9d6f-92ff78870f21" data-bw-event-track="true"><span><span>Buy  at Adorama</span></span></a><a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1928858-REG/canon_eos_r6_mark_iii.html?SID=bw-f494f9ad-c291[[[bf6275[" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-bw-imp-id="f494f9ad-c291-4a83-a6b1-a330f7b06da7" data-bw-id="bw-f494f9ad-c291" data-bw-nonce="b49c5dc1-ced6-4f71-9d6f-92ff78870f21" data-bw-event-track="true" data-bw-tag="bw-f494f9ad-c291[[[bf6275["><span><span>Buy  at B&amp;H Photo</span></span></a></p></div><hr></div>
