## 市场竞争 [64](#The EOS R6 III in context)
- 与 EOS R6 II, Nikon Z6III, Sony a7 IV 对比 [65](#Its predecessor was still quite a sensible option, so we've included it in the comparison, alongside the Nikon Z6III, which offers a similar combination of fast shooting, top-tier autofocus and incredible video specs. We're also comparing the Sony a7 IV, as its 33MP sensor makes it an obvious competitor, even if it can't match the speed of the other cameras on this list)
- Z6III 的部分堆叠传感器 [66](#The Z6III's partially Stacked sensor has higher read noise than other designs)
- a7 IV 逐渐过时 [67](#While the a7 IV is still a quite capable camera, it's starting to look a little dated compared to the competition)

- 默认打开颜色菜单按钮 (方便切换 Log/非 Log 录制) [99](#now has a button that defaults to opening the Color menu, making it a bit easier to switch between Log and non-Log recording)
- 提供 DCI 和 UHD 4K 选项 [100](#It provides both DCI and UHD 4K options)
- Raw 模式缺少 16:9, 但可从 open-gate 裁剪 UHD [101](#Its Raw mode also lacks a 16:9 mode, but can record open-gate at up to 30p, from which you can take a UHD crop)
- 自动对焦选项在所有录制模式下保持一致 [102](#Its autofocus options remain the same throughout its recording modes)
  - 连续自动对焦带主体识别 (即使在 4K/120 和 1080p/180) [103](#you still get continuous autofocus with subject recognition even when recording 4K/120 and 1080p/180)
  - 适用于标准视频和慢速/快速模式 [104](#This is true both in the standard video recording mode and in the Slow-and-Fast mode that doesn't record audio and produces a file that plays back at a slower framerate)
### 录制模式 [105](#Recording modes)
- 与 EOS C50 传感器相同, 但 R6 III 缺少一些电影级选项 [106](#While the EOS R6 III shares a sensor with the fan-cooled EOS C50, Canon includes several more options on its more cinema-focused camera. As an example, the EOS R6 III doesn't have an HQ Raw mode, nor does it support crop modes in Raw)
- 可将代理文件录制到 SD 卡 (Raw 视频时有用) [107](#It can, however, still record proxy files to its SD card slot, which could be quite useful when shooting Raw video)
- 4K 和 Full HD 模式可使用 "Fine" 超采样模式 [108](#Both the 4K and Full HD modes can be used in the "Fine" oversampling modes at all but their highest frame rates)
- 4K/60 Fine 模式图像质量不如 4K/30 及更慢模式 [109](#Canon does note that, while the 4K/60 Fine mode is still oversampled, it won't have the same image quality that you get from the 4K/30 and slower modes)
### 滚动快门 [110](#Rolling shutter)
- 全幅录制模式下滚动快门表现出色 [111](#The R6 III has some truly impressive rolling shutter rates across its full-width recording modes)
- "fine" 超采样设置可使读取速度大致翻倍 [112](#Using the oversampled "fine" setting will roughly double the readout speeds over the standard ones)
- 7K open gate 模式需谨慎 (17.9ms, 快速摇摄可能出现伪影) [113](#The only mode we'd advise any caution around is its 7K open gate setting. 17.9ms is still very fast, and will improve if you take a landscape crop of the frame, but if you're showing the full frame a little artifacting may start to creep in if you're capturing very fast pans or subjects)
### 温度限制 [114](#Temperature limits)
- 非风扇冷却 [115](#Unlike the video-focused EOS C50, the EOS R6 III is not fan-cooled)
- 连续录制时间 (23°C) [116](#Canon has given the following figures for continuous recording times at 23°C (73°F))
  - Raw 7K/60: 23 分钟 [117](#Raw 7K/60 23 min)
  - DCI 4K/120: 28-35 分钟 [118](#DCI 4K/120 28 min)
  - DCI 4K/60 Fine: 23 分钟 [119](#DCI 4K/60 Fine (oversampled) 23 min)
  - Open gate 7K/30 (MP4): 24-36 分钟 [120](#Open gate 7K/30 (MP4) 24 min)
- 子采样 4K/60 及 30p 及更慢的 4K 模式无温度限制 [121](#The subsampled 4K/60 modes along with both subsampled and oversampled 'Fine' 4K modes at 30p and slower have no temperature restrictions)
### 工作流程 [122](#Workflow)
- 视频辅助工具 [123](#Canon includes a variety of tools to help making shooting video and, in particular, nailing exposure, easier)
  - 波形监视器 [124](#waveform monitoring, which provides more detail about what parts of your image are clipping than a traditional histogram)
  - 伪色彩叠加 [125](#false color overlay, which makes it easier to tell if your skin tones are properly exposed)
- 视频模式下白平衡设置更方便 [126](#It's also now much easier to set your white balance in video mode; you can capture it from the live view, rather than having to set it from a still image on the card)
- 录制时可访问水平仪和放大功能 [127](#the camera also provides access to level gauges and magnification while recording)
- 可上传 LUTs 进行预览, 但不能烘焙到素材中 [128](#The EOS R6 III lets you upload LUTs into the camera, so you can preview an effect you wish to apply, but you can't bake the result into your footage)
- 可将低分辨率代理文件输出到 SD 卡 [129](#The EOS R6 III can output lower-resolution proxy files to an SD card while you capture your main footage to the CFexpress card)
- Open gate 拍摄时, Raw 可同时录制代理文件, MP4 不行 [130](#The only exception is Open gate shooting, where you can capture a proxy alongside Raw shooting but not if you're using MP4 as your main output)
- 缺少快门角度功能 (竞争对手有) [131](#One feature Canon's retained for its cinema cameras is shutter angle... It's a setting that most of the EOS R6 III's competitors, such as the Nikon Z6III and Panasonic S1II, have, but that it lacks)
## 初步印象 [132](#Initial Impressions)
- 令人惊讶的升级 [133](#Is it weird to say that the EOS R6 III is kind of surprising?)
- R6 II 仍具竞争力且销量领先 [134](#The EOS R6 II... is still a very competitive camera... Canon tells us it's the top-selling full-frame camera on the market, from any brand)
- 佳能的升级策略: "我们也要, 但更好" [135](#It feels like Canon looked at what the other companies were doing, and said "okay, us too, but better.")
  - 33MP (索尼有), 但结合尼康 Z6III 和松下 S1II 的高速 [136](#Sony's shooting 33MP? The EOS R6 III does too, but with the blistering speeds of the lower-res Nikon Z6III and Panasonic S1II)
  - Raw 视频 (竞争对手有) [137](#Those two cameras also offer Raw video, another spec the EOS R6 III has caught up on)
  - 全幅 4K 120p, open gate 录制 [138](#Canon threw in full-width 4K 120p for the people who like slow-mo, and open gate recording, since Panasonic shooters are so keen on it)
- 市场细分不明显 [139](#If there are features Canon cut to make its more expensive models more appealing, they aren't obvious to me)
- 仍主要面向静态摄影师, 但需兼顾视频 [140](#Canon says this camera is still squarely aimed at stills shooters, albeit ones who also need to be able to shoot video)
- 期待测试生产模型以评估图像质量 [141](#we're definitely looking forward to getting our hands on a production model to see if the ultra-fast sensor comes with any image quality impact)
- 6 系列的进化 [142](#we're clearly well into the evolution of Canon's 6-series line)
